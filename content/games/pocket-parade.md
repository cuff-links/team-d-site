Pocket Parade turns every level into a living music box. Players swap parade members, unlock instruments, and choreograph routes that delight townsfolk during the nightly lantern walk.

Difficulty scales gracefully for young players while offering meditative depth for seasoned puzzlers. Charming critters bring new instruments weekly, inviting you to remix arrangements and share your favorite festival routes with friends.
