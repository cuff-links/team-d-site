Starlight Valley is a love letter to peaceful nights and gentle discovery. Players steward a constellation conservatory, coaxing nebula plants to bloom and uncovering ancient melodies that rekindle the night sky.

Chart each evening's routine from the vantage point of floating islands, where friendly star sprites bring requests and lullabies guide the harvest. Every choice is contemplative, every friend is memorable, and every tune unlocks a new harmony in the universe.
