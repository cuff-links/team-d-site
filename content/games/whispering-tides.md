Whispering Tides invites players to wander, listen, and belong. Storybook visuals blend with adaptive music that remembers the player and evolves with every voyage.

Each island offers a short story told through food, friendship, and the sound of the sea. Collect recipes, sketch the skies, and compose sea shanties with your shipmate band before returning home to share the memories.
